For simplicity, let's use a format that is exactly the same with CSV.\n","\n","First of all, we need to create a `frictionless_csv2k` module containing a Plugin implementation and a Parser implementation but we're going to re-use the CsvParser as our new format is the same:\n","\n","> frictionless_csv2k.py\n","\n","```python\n","from frictionless import Plugin, parsers\n","\n","class Csv2kPlugin(Plugin):\n","    def create_parser(self, file):\n","        if file.format == \"csv2k\":\n","            return Csv2kParser(file)\n","\n","class Csv2kParser(parsers.CsvParser):\n","    pass\n","```\n","\n","Now, we can just use our new format in any of Frctionless functions that accept a table source, for example, `extract` or `Table`:\n","\n","```python\n","from frictionless import extract\n","\n","rows = extract('data/table.csv2k')\n","print(rows)\n","```\n","\n","This example is over-simplified to show the high-level mechanics but actually writing Frctionless Plugins is really easy. For inspiration, you can checks the `frictionless/plugins` directory and learn from real-life examples. Also, in the Frictionless codebase there are many `Check`, `Control`, `Dialect`, `Loader`, `Parser`, and `Server` implementations - you can read their code for better understanding of how to write your own subclass.\n"]}]}
