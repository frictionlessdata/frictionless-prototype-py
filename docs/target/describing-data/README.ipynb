The reason for having metadata is simple: usually, data files themselves are not capable of providing enough information. For example, if you have a data table in a CSV format, it misses a few critical pieces of information:\n","- meaning of the fields e.g., what the `size` field means; is it clothes size or file size\n","- data types information e.g., is this field a string or an integer\n","- data constraints e.g., the minimum temperature for your measurements\n","- data relations e.g., identifiers connection\n","- and others\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"NZZ48jzUrM-O","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["! pip install frictionless"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bxX922q1_B_O","colab_type":"text"},"source":["\n","For a dataset, there is even more information that can be provided like general dataset purpose, information about data sources, list of authors, and many more. Of course, when there are many tabular files, relational rules can be very important. Usually, there are foreign keys ensuring the integrity of the dataset; for example, there is some reference table containing country names and other tables using it as a reference. Data in this form is called \"normalized data\" and it occurs very often in scientific and another kind of research.\n","\n","Having a general understanding of what is \"data describing\", we can now articulate why it's important:\n","- **data validation**; metadata helps to reveal problems in your data on the early stages of your workflow\n","- **data publication**; metadata provides additional information that your data can't include\n","\n","There are not the only two pros of having metadata but they are two the most important.
